# Regular expression for validating an email address 

Yes, adding the `^` at the beginning and the `$` at the end of your regular expression is a good practice for email validation. This ensures that the entire input string is matched against the pattern from start to finish, providing more accurate validation for email addresses. 

Here is your improved regular expression for validating email addresses:

```regex
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,}$
```

With these anchors in place, the regular expression will now require the email address to start at the beginning of the input string and end at the specified TLD length, enhancing the accuracy of your email validation. This modification helps ensure that the input exactly matches the pattern you've defined for a valid email address.
